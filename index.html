            <div class="bio">
                <p>I was born in New Jersey, moved to CA when I was 15, and I've lived in the Sacramento area ever since. I graduated from Sacramento State University with a B.A. in Mathematics but while a student started developing solutions in FileMaker Pro, and learning how to administer networks and servers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professionally, I've worked for the State of CA, a technology startup, started my own technology company, contracted with various companies, and currently work for a bio tech company that makes immune system diagnostic kits. I've primarily used a software environment called 4D but I'm most interested in web and mobile development. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the late 1990's I had an opportunity to do a software project for the CA State Fair Commercial Wine Competition. While there, I met some folks that were home winemakers and started making wine. More recently, I started making beer, in particular IPAs. I've worked with a number of commercial wineries in the area, picking, crushing, pressing, and bottling. I've even managed a vineyard for a couple of years. I'm a member of the Sacramento Home Winemakers.
